My personal relationship with coding has been a rollcoaster for a while. I grappled with the idea of becoming a programmer for quite a long time. I would straggle from one free coding video to the next free developer course like they were going out of style. I would learn bits and pieces of programming language like an archeologist chipping away at some monolith he didn't fully understand. Then, the world flipped upside down.


The changes in the world forced me to confront the very thing I had been pondering for several years ; who do you want be? I had been a vagabond in many ways throughout my life. I had always cherished experience over monetary or material gain but that can only take you so far. Physical and laborous jobs are amazing for the mind and body. They teach you to meditate through action and I learned a lot through rough, labor jobs. But, what is a future that rests solely on the stamina of your bones? 40 years at a back breaking job gets you a broken back (no disrespect to those who choose it). I craved stimulation from another realm ; the mind.

Leading up this course, I completed as much of the pre-work as I could. I felt pretty confident with HTML, CSS and possibly some Javascript. I had followed some code-alongs so I felt like I knew a little more than a beginner. Wow, was I ever so wrong. The beginning lectures were fun and I found the atmosphere engaging. The simple act of being able to listen to someone speak about code was a rush and that was suprising. I thought to myself, " you're getting hooked. "  and "This was gonna be a lot of fun". Then, the labs hit.

Bam!! Smack!!! Pow!!!! Wait, wait, wait!! Hold on. How do I do that? That wasn't in the lesson material? Maybe I'll Google what they are asking for? no, that Stack OverFlow thread just makes me dizzy. wait, I'll search just for that method. nope, I'm not clear on how to utilize it in this scenario. I can't do this. I don't get it. I'm not smart enough and I'll never understand any of this. Pit of despair incoming........

Help! How do I do this? The words erupted from my mind on to the keyboard. The simple act of asking for help was a revolution for my mind. Wait, so I didn't have to be a superstar immediately? I didn't have to breeze through the course material like I had been coding for years. No, you don't. You learn.

As a creative type(music, drawing, etc), I found my mind never suited me for logical thinking. Who cares how I got to C? A and B dont matter, my friend. Oh, but they do. I found that by slamming into the walls of my mind, I was slamming into my ultimate weakness ; slowing down.

What a revelation!! Slow down, ponder this thing. What must A and B do to get C? How does this happen? Why did it happen? I found the act of maintaining that though process as the labs got more and more complex to be exhausting. How could my mind be so weak? Well, thats because you've never spent this amount of time activating your logical brain. It needs to get in shape and it needs to get in shape fast. Did you foget you where in a bootcamp? Yeah, I kind of did.

So, two weeks in and I feel like its been months since day one. There is so much more to learn, so much more to digest but I remain positive. I hit the pit of despair twice but I gave myself no option to retreat. How badly do you want a new life or career? So I continue, day by day, hour by hour, lab by lab, test by test. Repeating the line: "You are in the process of learning how to think." 



Cheers,
Berkley Brown
