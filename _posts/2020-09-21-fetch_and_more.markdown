This week's project was all about using Rails with Javascript. We built a one page application using Rails as an API and Javascript for the frontend. I'm gonna be honest, I had a very stressful week and this project came at a crazy time for me but I pushed on through. I think understanding fetch was the most interesting thing for me to learn. Fetch is an API that is built into Javascript. This allows you to make HTTP requests to URLs and retrieve data. The fetch method will take in a URL as a parameter and retrieve said data. It returns this data in the form of a promise and that allows you to then use  the then method. You are then able to manipulate that data. You can than JSONify that data and use it for iterating  and rendering or showing the data to a user. This really allows you to grab different sets of data from the database and display it on one page. This is much more modern approach to web applications were most people do not want to click links to different page. This allows for a more seamless experience for the user.
